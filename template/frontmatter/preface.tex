\subsubsection{Outline}
This Ph.D. thesis deals with several distinct topics. The thesis works as an introduction to the field by integrating a summary of the major findings of my research activity with some additional background material.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter~\ref{ch:1} introduces the theory.
    
    \item Chapter~\ref{ch:2} discusses simulations of Ref.~\cite{Doe_PRB_2021, Doe_npjFP_2022}.
    
    \item Chapter~\ref{ch:3} is an adaptation of Ref.~\cite{Doe_2023}. 
    
\end{itemize}
